EM algorithm implementation from scratch for clustering on different dimensions
Language: R
Date: 17 November

Description: This kernel is an implementation from scratch of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, we used the wine data from the pgmm library,
then we clustered the wine according to some features to classify the brand of wine, then we compared with k-means and true labels.
